## The Language

Nix, just like Make, has it's own syntax to describe builds.

It's called the "Nix Expression" language.

### Syntax

Nix has JSON-like data structures:

An "attribute set" or "attrset" or "set" which is pretty much like a
JSON object:

[source,nix]
----
{
  myKey = "my-value";
}
----

A list:

[source,nix]
----
[ 1 2 3 ]
----

Notice the lack of commas in the list. It takes a bit of time to get
used to it but is something that I have come to miss in other
languages.

Some data types:

[source,nix]
----
{
  # I am a comment
  /* and a multi-line
  comment */
  aNumber = 1;
  aFloat = 1.2;
  aString = "hi, I am a string";
  aMultiLineString = ''
    unlike HEREDOC
    the string is automatically
    de-indented
  '';
  booleans = [ true false ];
  andNull = null;
}
----

And finally there is the function:

[source,nix]
----
arg1: arg1 + arg1
----
